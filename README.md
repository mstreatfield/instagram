Instagram Challenge
===================

The Problem
-----------

On their [blog][1] Instagram's engineering team recently posted a small [Python challenge][2] to win a T-Shirt.  

Inspired by their in-office paper shredder, the team came up with the problem of reconstructing the shredded image (below) into it's original form.

On their [blog][2], they post advice about using [Python's Imaging Library, PIL][4] to solve the problem as well as a few other guidelines and tips.

The Solution
------------

So, I had a go at solving this particular problem, and this GitHub repository contains the source code I came up with.  Unfortunately, so far I have failed!  This is the closest I can get to an unshredded image:

Although all the strips or shreds are correctly sorted, the resulting image is wrapped and so is incorrect.  Answers on a postcard!
